;=====================================

;One of the main challenges I had while doing this lab was understanding how to use system calls like 
;int 0x80 to actually print characters to the screen. At first, I wasnâ€™t sure how the output and 
;linefeed parts worked together, and I was confused about why I needed to push and pop eax. It took 
;me some time to realize that system calls change the values in registers, so saving and restoring the 
;letter was important to keep the loop working right. Another thing I struggled with was keeping track
;of the ASCII values. I kept forgetting that `A` starts at 65 and that the loop had to stop at 91 to 
;include `Z`. Overall, getting the loop and procedures to work together was tricky at first, but once 
;I figured it out, it started to make more sense.
