;======================================

;One of the biggest challenges I faced was just figuring out how to break the problem into smaller steps that I could code in assembly. Iâ€™m still getting used ;to the syntax and how everything needs to be done through registers. It was also hard at first to figure out how to compare values and store the largest one ;without messing something up. I had to go back to the examples from class a few times and test different things in GDB to see what was going on. It took me a ;bit to get the logic to work, especially making sure the right number was stored at the end. But once I got more comfortable reading the comparisons and ;jumps, it started to make more sense.
